# 📘 TypeScript Fundamentals & Deep Dive

Welcome to the **TypeScript Learning Repository**! This repo is designed to help you (and others) build a **strong foundational understanding** of TypeScript through practical code examples.

Whether you're coming from JavaScript or diving into TypeScript for the first time, this repository will help you **learn by doing**, with each folder dedicated to a focused topic.

## 🚀 Why TypeScript?

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds **strong static typing**, **better tooling**, and **more robust code**—especially helpful in larger projects.

- ✅ Better autocompletion and IDE support
- ✅ Catches errors at compile-time instead of runtime
- ✅ Supports modern JavaScript features and future proposals
- ✅ Makes code more predictable and maintainable

Each folder in this repository will contain:

- Topic-specific examples
- `README.md` (inside the folder) to explain the concept
- Comments in code to explain the logic
- Mini-projects or sample use-cases (in some topics)
